6. International transfers
==========================
 
If you are located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and have signed up to use our Website, your personal information will be transferred to our servers outside the EEA, located in the United States. The United States is deemed by the European Union to provide inadequate data protection. However, we have put in place safeguards to protect personal information transferred outside these jurisdictions, and will comply with the relevant data protection laws applicable to us, including the General Data Protection Regulation, to ensure a sufficient level of protection of your personal information. Please refer to the information set out in the Data security section below.

7. Data security
================

We are committed to ensuring that your personal data is secure with us. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way. 

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are legally required to do so.

8. Data retention
=================

Your personal data will be processed for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for (as outlined in the :ref:`How we use your personal data <personal_data>` section above). For example, we will process your personal data for as long as necessary to continue to provide you with the Service on our Website.

In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data: see Your legal rights below for further information.

9. Expectation of privacy in Kolibri Studio
===========================================

The Kolibri ecosystem of tools make high quality education technology available in low-resource communities such as rural schools, refugee camps, orphanages, non-formal school systems, and prison systems. Kolibri Studio is the tool used to organize content and build content channels for the Kolibri Learning Platform, an open-source platform specially designed to provide offline access to freely distributable educational content. As such, with the exclusion of personally identifying information, records and products of activities undertaken within the platform (uploading, downloading, organizing, annotating, or creating content) are not private and there should be no expectation of privacy regarding the output of these activities. Learning Equality has access to all the generated content and other data in Kolibri Studio and handles it according to its :ref:`Terms and Conditions <tos>`.

.. _glossary_privacy:


13. Glossary
============

**Consent** means processing your personal data where you have signified your agreement by a statement or clear opt-in to processing for a specific purpose. Consent will only be valid if it is a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of what you want. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us. 

**Legitimate interest** means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.

**Performance of contract** means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

**Comply with a legal obligation** means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.

**Third parties** means anyone outside of Learning Equality personnel. 

**Your legal rights**

Persons in the EEA have the right to:

* **Request access to your personal data** (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
* **Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.** This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
* **Request erasure of your personal data.** This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
* **Object to processing of your personal data** where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
* **Request restriction of processing of your personal data**. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:

   * if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
   * where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
   * where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
   * you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

* **Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.** We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
* **Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.** However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
