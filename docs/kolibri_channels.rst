Kolibri channels
################

The main purpose of Kolibri Studio is to allow you to build learning *packages* called **channels** according to your needs. You can build channels by uploading your own learning resources (exercises, videos, audio or document files), or by importing them from publicly available channels.

A Kolibri **channel** is a collection of educational resources (exercises, videos, audio or document files) and associated metadata, prepared and organized for their use in Kolibri. 

Kolibri channels can be public or private/unlisted.

Public channels
===============

Kolibri application can serve content from several publicly available channels, which administrators may choose to import and use on devices in their facilities.

You can access Kolibri public channels the Kolibri Studio website, in order to view and import content from them, but you cannot edit them. You can, however, offer to contribute by translating/localizing, adding voice-over, and reporting issues. Contact the LE team for further guidance regarding contributions on public channels.

Learning Equality team performs regular updates of the publicly available channels on the Kolibri Studio site, to keep them aligned when the original sources change. Channels imported into Kolibri will display a notification when the updated content is available, but the administrators at the local Kolibri installation will evaluate the most appropriate update timeframes according to each deployment needs.

To use a publicly available Kolibri channel, all you need to know is the **channel token** in order to import it into the local Kolibri installation. Find the :ref:`channel token in the details page for any channel in Kolibri Studio <share_channels>`.

Private or unlisted channels
============================

**Kolibri Studio** provides the tools to build and curate your own custom channels. As a content curator you can use resources from public channels and combine it with your own imported ones to build custom channels, aligned to the local curricula, or according to your specific learning needs.

Who will use Kolibri Studio to curate channels will depend on the setting in which Kolibri is deployed. Content curation tasks may be the responsibility of the same person who installed Kolibri, or require different and separate roles.

In case of your private/unlisted channels, only users who receive the channel token can view and use the channel.
