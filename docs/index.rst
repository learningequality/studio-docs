*Select and organize the learning resources for Kolibri*

`Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org>`_ is the tool used to organize learning resources and build channels for `Kolibri <https://learningequality.org/kolibri/>`_, an open-source platform specially designed to provide offline access to educational content. 

Kolibri runs in a local network (LAN), and serves the connected devices (computers, tablets, etc.), but does not include any content upon installation. To be able to serve the learning resources to their local users, facility administrators must import channels into Kolibri.

While it is possible to install **Kolibri** and import channels without an active Internet connection, you need to to access the `Kolibri Studio <https://studio.learningequality.org>`_ online in order to start curating a new channel, or update an existing one with new learning materials.
